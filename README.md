# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:

Step1 :
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation

Step 2:
Prepare the lists from each equations and assign in np.array()

Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the inverse of the given matrix

Step 4:
End the program 

## Program:

#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
```
import numpy as np
A = [[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]]
B = np.linalg.inv(A)
print(B)
```
